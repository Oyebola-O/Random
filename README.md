# Random
This code is going to be used for my pathfinding robor. In the end, I have to refactor it to work in a 10X10 maze whith squares which are 9cm each.

The robot will estimate the location of the obstacles and fill them out as it heads towards the given coordinates.

Right now, the code in robot.c works as a simulation of the anticipated results
